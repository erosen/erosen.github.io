About Me
========

Currently I am in my first semester as a Graduate student at Rutgers University studying Computer Engineering. Current course work includes; Computer Architecture and Transistor Circuit Design. 

As a Teaching Assistant, I designed the lab component to a new course offered at Rutgers - ECE 493/519: Hardware/Software Embedded Systems - where students learn the VHDL hardware description language and complete activities based on latches and flipflops, ALUs, memories, processors, and hardware interfaces.

Past course work relevant to my desired field of work include; Electronic Devices, Digital Logic Design, **Digital System Design**, Digital Electronics, Programming Methodology, **Operating Systems**, Robotics & Computer Vision, Software Engineering, and **Intro to VLSI**.

Along with my course work, I am currently the GOLD (Graduates of the Last Decade) Chair of the  [IEEE](http://www.ieee.org) Princeton / Central Jersey Section. Previously I was the Chair for the IEEE Student Branch at Rutgers.
