<p>I am currently in my Junior year at Rutgers University studying Computer and Electrical Engineering. Current course work includes; Discrete Mathematics, Digital Electronics, Operating Systems, Software Engineering, and Marketing for Entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>In Software Engineering, I am working on a full scale home automation design project that includes web panel integration with physical devices and the ability to automatically control digital and analog devices. Current project work including reports can be found <a href="https://github.com/autohomeproject/auto/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Along with my course work, I am currently the Vice President of the IEEE student branch. Our current work can be found on our website <a href="http://ieee.rutgers.edu">ieee.rutgers.edu</a>. I spend most of my time working on our entry to the 2012 Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition in Rochester Michigan this coming June. </p>
