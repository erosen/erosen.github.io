<p>I am currently in my Senior year at Rutgers University studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. Current course work includes; Digital System Design, Finance for Entrpreneurs and Small Business, Intro to Entrepreneurship, Managing Growing Business Ventures, Robotics & Computer Vision and VLSI Design</p>

<p>In the Spring 2012 semester, I worked on a home automation design project that included web panel integration with physical devices and the ability to automatically control digital and analog devices. Current project work including reports can be found <a href="https://github.com/autohomeproject/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Along with my course work, I am currently the President of the IEEE student branch. Our current work can be found on our website <a href="http://ieee.rutgers.edu">ieee.rutgers.edu</a>. I spend most of my time working on our entry to the 2013 Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition in Rochester Michigan this coming June. </p>
