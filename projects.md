**Computer Vision-Based 3D Reconstruction for Object Replication**  
For my Senior Capstone Design, I am developing a 3D Replicator. By using a Microsoft Kinect, we scan and reconstruct objects into 3D models which are then converted in to machine readable G-Code for printing. Current code, drivers, documentation, and papers can be found [here](https://github.com/KinectReplicator). The project is advised by [Professor Kristin Dana](http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~kdana/Home.html) and is fully funded by a grant sponsored by the [IEEE Princeton / Central Jersey Section - IEEE PCJS](http://ewh.ieee.org/r1/princeton-centraljersey/).

**Independent Study on Field Programmable Gate Arrays**  
FPGAs are something that I have had a lot of interest in for quite some time, but I never had an opportunity to study due to lack of time and my involvement in other activities. The goal of this study is to program an Intel 8086 microprocessor on to an Altera Cyclone III. Once working, MS-DOS will be installed to flash memory to demonstrate the processors capabilities . This project is advised by [Professor Michael Caggiano](http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/faculty/caggiano) and is fully sponsored through the [Altera University Program](http://www.altera.com/education/univ/unv-index.html).

**autoHome - Advanced Utility to Operate Home**  
In the Spring 2012 semester, I worked on a home automation design project that included web panel integration with physical devices and the ability to automatically control digital and analog devices. Final project work including reports can be found [here](https://github.com/autohomeproject/).
