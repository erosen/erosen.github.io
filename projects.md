**Computer Vision-Based 3D Reconstruction for Object Replication**  
For my Senior Capstone Design, I am developing a 3D Replicator. By using a Microsoft Kinect, we scan and reconstruct objects into 3D models which are then converted in to machine readable G-Code for printing. Current code, drivers, documentation, and papers can be found [here](https://github.com/KinectReplicator). The project is advised by [Professor Kristin Dana](http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~kdana/Home.html) and is fully funded by a grant sponsored by the [IEEE Princeton / Central Jersey Section - IEEE PCJS](http://ewh.ieee.org/r1/princeton-centraljersey/).

**Independent Study on Field Programmable Gate Arrays**  
FPGAs are something that I have had a lot of interest in for quite some time, but I never had an opportunity to study due to lack of time and my involvement in other activities. The goal of this project is to create a modified OpenRISC based processor for running an operating system such as Linux. This project is advised by [Professor Michael Caggiano](http://www.ece.rutgers.edu/faculty/caggiano) and is fully sponsored through the [Altera University Program](http://www.altera.com/education/univ/unv-index.html).

**autoHome - Advanced Utility to Operate Home**  
In the Spring 2012 semester, I worked on a home automation design project that included web panel integration with physical devices and the ability to automatically control digital and analog devices. Final project work including reports can be found [here](https://github.com/autohomeproject/).
